COMPLEX NEWTON
==============

Nicholas Walker

Purpose:

This program generates a random complex-valued polynomial and then uses Newton's method to generate a fractal pattern. The displayed plot is an animation of the successive results from each iteration.

Usage:

Simply run the program.

Development:

I do not intend to add much more to the program or comment the code. This was more of a proof of concept than anything else, but turned out pretty cool.
